## Project Overview
The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured framework to support machine learning projects from data ingestion to model deployment. The primary goals include:

- Automating repetitive tasks to boost productivity
- Ensuring reproducibility of model training and deployment
- Enabling scalability with tools such as Docker, MLflow, and logging frameworks

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess data seamlessly.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Use `DataPreprocessing` to handle data transformations and feature engineering.
- **Model Training and Tuning**: Implement custom training pipelines, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- **Model Serving**: Support for deployment on various platforms.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Track experiments and log metrics with MLflow.
- **Scalability**: Use Docker for containerization, making the pipeline reproducible and scalable.

## Installation
To get started with the MLOps project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/armandoBringas/MLOps.git
   cd MLOps
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Set up environment variables as per your needs (e.g., for MLflow URI or Docker settings).

## Usage
- **Data Preprocessing**: Import and configure `DataPreprocessing` for your dataset.
- **Training**: Run the training script to train models, experiment with different configurations, and log results.
- **Evaluation**: Use evaluation utilities to assess model performance on test data.
- **Deployment**: Follow deployment scripts to serve your model.

```bash
python src/train.py  # Example command to start model training
```
